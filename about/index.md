title: About

Being passionate about software development but not really doing it professionally anymore, I like to focus on technologies helping developers, application owners, operation teams to achive their goals with minimum effort. 

One such area is Application Performmance Monitoring and Full Stack Observability. Being employee of Cisco Systems, I get in touch with existing and potential customers of Cisco technologies like AppDynamics, ThousandEyes, and Intersight a lot. Also, I like to work and keep an eye on projects we have, identify potential rooms for improvement in our product portfolio and test some of those ideas myself. 

Here you can find some work of mine I find useful for general use or as an idea someone may follow upon.

Have a good read,
